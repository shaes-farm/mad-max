# BED REMOVAL & FUEL/BRAKE SYSTEM RESTORATION

## 1986 Jeep Comanche MJ — Comprehensive Procedure

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Vehicle:** 1986 Jeep Comanche MJ (VIN: 1JTHL6571GT042524)  
**Project:** "Mad Maxine" Daily Driver Restoration  
**Scope:** Bed removal, fuel tank inspection/restoration, fuel line replacement, brake cable replacement, wiring harness disconnect/relocation  
**Timeline:** 3-4 weekends, 20-30 hours total  
**Budget:** $300-500 (parts + supplies)

---

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This procedure guides the complete removal of the truck bed and all interconnected systems behind the cab, allowing for:

1. Frame treatment with POR-15 rust prevention
2. Fuel tank inspection, cleaning, and rust-proofing
3. Complete fuel line replacement with high-pressure rated components
4. Parking brake cable replacement and system restoration
5. Wiring harness relocation and cleanup

**Why This Matters:** Your '86 is mostly rust-free underneath, making this the ideal time to apply comprehensive rust prevention before road salt accelerates deterioration. Doing everything at once (bed, fuel system, brake lines, wiring) minimizes future reassembly and ensures all systems are fresh and reliable.

## CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS

⚠️ **FUEL SYSTEM HAZARD:**
- Work outdoors only (fuel vapors)
- No smoking, open flames, or spark-producing tools near fuel tank
- Drain tank completely before any work
- Keep fire extinguisher rated for flammable liquid nearby
- Wear chemical-resistant gloves when handling fuel residue
- Allow tank to air dry for 24+ hours after draining before interior inspection

⚠️ **LIFTING & SUPPORT HAZARD:**
- Never work under vehicle supported by jack only
- Use jack stands at minimum; use proper hoist if available
- Ensure proper footing and stable work surface
- Keep bystanders away from work area

⚠️ **ELECTRICAL HAZARD:**
- Disconnect battery negative terminal BEFORE disconnecting any fuel pump wiring
- Keep electrical connectors dry
- Verify fuel pump is de-energized before tank removal

⚠️ **EXHAUST HAZARD:**
- If disconnecting exhaust from bed: allow to cool completely
- Touching hot exhaust causes severe burns
- Work only on cold engine

## TOOLS REQUIRED

### Essential Tools (Must Have)

**Mechanical:**
- Socket set (1/2" drive, deep wells for bed bolts)
- Wrench set (metric and SAE, focus on 15mm bolts)
- Breaker bar (leverage for stuck fasteners)
- Ratchets (3/8" and 1/2" drive)
- Extensions (multiple lengths, especially for inside bed access)
- Pliers (needle-nose, slip-joint)
- Screwdrivers (Phillips and flat head, multiple sizes)
- Wire cutters/strippers
- Flashlight or work light
- Jack and jack stands (or hoist)
- Drain pan (large, for fuel tank residue)

**Penetrating & Lubrication:**
- PB Blaster or Würth Rost Off (for rusted bolts) — ESSENTIAL
- Engine oil or WD-40 (general lubrication)
- Brake fluid (new, DOT 3 or DOT 4)

**Fuel System:**
- Fuel siphon pump (manual or electric 12V)
- Fuel line clamps (hose clamps for old lines, new proper clamps for new lines)
- Fuel line disconnect tool (if equipped with spring clamps)
- Clean glass or plastic fuel container (approved for gasoline)

**Cleaning & Protection:**
- Wire brush (hand and rotary wire wheel for drill)
- Shop towels and rags
- Degreaser (Simple Green, Purple Power)
- Compressed air source
- Tarp or plastic sheeting (protect cab and surrounding area)
- Painter's tape (marking bolts, connectors)
- Masking tape and permanent markers (labeling everything)

**Safety:**
- Safety glasses or face shield
- Chemical-resistant gloves (nitrile not adequate for fuel; use neoprene)
- Respirator (P100 cartridge if grinding rust or welding prep)
- Fire extinguisher (Class B rated for flammable liquids)
- First aid kit

### Helpful But Not Required

- Impact wrench (speeds up bolt removal, but hand tools work)

## PART 1: PREPARATION & SAFETY CHECKS

### Checkpoint 1.1: Pre-Work Safety & Planning

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**When:** Before touching any tools

#### Task 1.1.1: Battery Disconnection

- [ ] Locate battery under hood (driver side)
- [ ] Disconnect negative terminal FIRST (prevents accidental short circuits)
- [ ] Remove negative cable and tape terminal to prevent reconnection
- [ ] **Verify:** No electrical loads active (lights off, key out)
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes for electrical system to discharge

**Why:** Protects fuel pump circuit and prevents accidental starter engagement. Essential before disconnecting any fuel system wiring.

#### Task 1.1.2: Workspace Preparation

- [ ] Choose well-ventilated area (outdoor only, no enclosed garage)
- [ ] Position truck on level, solid surface
- [ ] Clear area of unnecessary items
- [ ] Lay tarp under work area for drips
- [ ] Place fire extinguisher within 10 feet
- [ ] Verify no ignition sources nearby
- [ ] Position work lights for visibility
- [ ] Have phone nearby for emergency

#### Task 1.1.3: Fuel Tank Drainage

⚠️ **CRITICAL STEP — DO NOT SKIP**

- [ ] Ensure battery is disconnected (Step 1.1.1)
- [ ] Locate fuel filler cap (right side of truck bed)
- [ ] Remove filler cap and set aside
- [ ] Locate fuel pump location in tank (center bottom)
- [ ] Prepare large drain pan underneath
- [ ] **Method A: Gravity Drain (safer)**
  - [ ] Raise truck on hoist or lift carefully onto jack stands
  - [ ] Place drain pan under fuel line exit point on driver frame rail
  - [ ] Locate fuel line clamp nearest to tank
  - [ ] Use fuel line disconnect tool or carefully remove hose clamp
  - [ ] Gently pull fuel line free and direct into drain pan
  - [ ] Let gravity drain tank completely (may take 20-30 minutes)
  - [ ] Fuel will slow to drips as tank empties — wait until absolutely stopped

- [ ] **Method B: Siphon Pump (faster, requires care)**
  - [ ] Use manual hand pump or 12V electric siphon pump
  - [ ] Insert pump inlet through filler neck to tank bottom
  - [ ] Direct discharge into approved fuel container
  - [ ] Siphon until no more fuel flows
  - **NEVER** use mouth-powered siphon (fuel ingestion hazard)

- [ ] **After Drainage:**
  - [ ] Smell tank opening — should have minimal fuel odor
  - [ ] Verify drain pan is completely collected (dispose properly)
  - [ ] Allow tank to air for 30 minutes minimum before proceeding
  - [ ] **Document:** Fuel volume drained (note for budget records)

#### Task 1.1.4: Penetrant Application (Start 24 Hours Before Bed Removal)

⚠️ **This step sets up success — do not rush**

- [ ] Identify all 8 bed mounting bolt locations (see diagram below)
- [ ] Spray each bolt location generously with PB Blaster or Würth Rost Off
- [ ] Concentrate on bolts hidden under bed sides (hardest to reach)
- [ ] Allow minimum 24 hours soak time (48-72 hours is better)
- [ ] Reapply penetrant after 12 hours (once during soak)
- [ ] Document which bolts were accessed (marks rust pattern)

**Bed Bolt Locations (8 total for long-bed MJ):**

```
      CAB
      ___
   2 |   | 1
  ===|   |===  (Front crossmember)
   
   4 |   | 3
  ===|   |===  (Rear of rear axle arch)
   
   6 |   | 5
  ===|   |===  (Flat frame rail areas)
   
   8 |   | 7
  ===|   |===  (Rear frame rails)
     GROUND

All bolts: 15mm, likely rusted
2 front bolts: studs on bed underside
6 rear bolts: accessed from underneath bed sides
```

**Reference:** ComancheClub thread user "JeepcoMJ" recommends this exact approach

---

### Checkpoint 1.2: System Disconnection (Dry Run)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**When:** Evening before actual removal (verify nothing is missed)

#### Task 1.2.1: Photograph Existing Configuration

Before disconnecting anything, create a visual reference:

- [ ] Take closeup photos of all connections behind cab (phone camera fine)
- [ ] Photo 1: Tail light harness connector (rear driver side bed)
- [ ] Photo 2: Fuel fill neck hoses (driver side frame rail)
- [ ] Photo 3: Fuel vent line routing (usually routed along frame)
- [ ] Photo 4: Emergency brake bracket bolts (underside bed, center)
- [ ] Photo 5: Main fuel line routing from tank to firewall
- [ ] Photo 6: Any aftermarket wiring or clamps
- [ ] Create "Before Disconnection" folder in your documentation

#### Task 1.2.2: Identify All Fuel System Connections

Fuel connections (critical to find before draining is critical):

- [ ] **Fuel outlet line:** Steel hard line from tank bottom (driver side) going toward firewall
  - Hose clamp connection at tank
  - Runs along driver frame rail inside bed
  - Exits bed area near firewall
  - **Check:** Mark with masking tape "FUEL OUT"

- [ ] **Fuel return line:** (if equipped on your Renix system)
  - Some '86 models have return line, some don't
  - If present: smaller diameter, loops back to tank
  - **Check:** Trace from engine bay backward; see if it re-enters bed
  - **Mark:** If found, mark with tape "FUEL RETURN"

- [ ] **Fuel fill neck hose:** Rubber line from filler cap to tank
  - Two hose clamps (one at cap, one at tank)
  - Usually routed along driver side of bed
  - **Mark:** With tape "FUEL FILL NECK"

- [ ] **Fuel vent line:** Small rubber line from tank vent valve
  - Routes back to charcoal canister or vapor recovery
  - Often overlooked, easy to tear if not identified
  - **Mark:** With tape "FUEL VENT"

**Reference:** NAXJA forum user notes: "Gas tank straps into frame rail on driver's side and up into cross-members on passenger side" — verify your tank orientation.

#### Task 1.2.3: Identify All Brake/Parking Brake Connections

- [ ] **E-brake bracket:** Bolted to underside bed, center area
  - Three 15mm bolts (per ComancheClub consensus)
  - Cables exit forward toward cab
  - **Check:** Trace cables from bracket toward firewall
  - **Mark:** With tape "E-BRAKE BRACKET"

- [ ] **Parking brake cables:** Two cables exiting bracket
  - Left cable: routed along left frame to front
  - Right cable: routed along right frame to front
  - Enter cab through firewall grommet
  - **Note:** Yours are currently disconnected — check cab side
  - **Mark:** Both with tape "BRAKE CABLE - LEFT/RIGHT"

- [ ] **Brake hard lines:** Steel lines from master cylinder
  - Route along frame rails
  - May be clipped to frame or bed
  - Look for corrosion or damage
  - **Document:** Any damage with photos
  - **Mark:** With tape "BRAKE LINE - DO NOT DISTURB" (unless you planned replacement)

#### Task 1.2.4: Identify Wiring Harness Connections

- [ ] **Tail light harness:** Connector at rear driver side (under bed)
  - Usually 4-6 wires (stop, turn, running lights)
  - Plastic connector, likely corroded
  - **Mark:** With tape "TAIL LIGHT CONNECTOR"

- [ ] **Fuel pump power line:** From engine bay
  - Runs along driver side toward tank
  - Red or brown wire with white tracer (typical)
  - Connected to fuel pump inside tank (may not be visible)
  - **Status:** Battery is disconnected, so this is safe to work near
  - **Mark:** With tape "FUEL PUMP POWER"

- [ ] **License plate light:** (if wired to bed)
  - May be mounted on tailgate
  - Could be clipped to bed structure
  - **Check:** Trace from license plate area
  - **Mark:** If found, "LICENSE PLATE LIGHT"

**Reference:** ComancheClub user "earl*t" warns: "Wiring harness runs along driver side frame rail and is connected to bed by plastic loom fasteners — found out the hard way." Plan to free all clips.

## PART 2: BED REMOVAL PROCEDURE

### Checkpoint 2.1: Disconnect All Systems (Day 1 - Evening)

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Checkpoint 1.1 & 1.2 complete, 24-hour penetrant soak on bolts

#### Task 2.1.1: Disconnect Tail Light Harness

- [ ] Locate connector at rear driver side (visible from underneath bed)
- [ ] Use two flathead screwdrivers to carefully pry apart plastic connector halves
  - **Technique:** Insert screwdriver gently into connector lock, pry slowly
  - **Avoid:** Forcing connector (wires may break inside)
  - **If stuck:** Apply a small amount of penetrating oil and wait 5 minutes
- [ ] Separate connector completely
- [ ] Label both halves with tape: "TAIL LIGHT CONNECTOR - BED SIDE" and "TRUCK SIDE"
- [ ] Tape connector ends to prevent moisture intrusion
- [ ] Take photo of disconnected connector

**Reference:** NAXJA forum: "Disconnect the e-brake equalizer and wiring harness clipped to frame"

#### Task 2.1.2: Disconnect Fuel Fill Neck Hoses

⚠️ **Fuel System Work — Follow Carefully**

- [ ] **Battery:** Verify still disconnected (Step 1.1.1)
- [ ] **Location:** Driver side frame rail, near cab/bed junction
- [ ] **Identify:**
  - Large diameter rubber hose (fill neck inlet)
  - Small hose (overflow/vent from tank)
- [ ] **Fill neck hose:**
  - Locate hose clamp at tank connection
  - Use screwdriver to loosen hose clamp (turn counterclockwise)
  - Gently twist hose at connection point to loosen
  - Carefully pull hose free
  - Expect small amount of fuel residue — have shop towel ready
  - Cap hose end with cloth or tape to prevent debris

- [ ] **Overflow/vent hose:**
  - Smaller diameter, routed upward toward filler cap area
  - Loosen hose clamp same way
  - Carefully pull free
  - May have check valve — handle gently
  - Cap hose end

- [ ] **After disconnection:**
  - Verify no fuel drips (if tank was drained properly, there should be none)
  - Wrap both hoses in plastic bag and secure with rubber band
  - Label: "FUEL FILL & VENT HOSES"
  - Place hoses inside bed to keep with truck during removal

**Reference:** NAXJA forum: "Also, the gas tank straps into the frame rail on the drivers side, and up into the cross members on the passenger side."

#### Task 2.1.3: Identify and Document Brake Lines

⚠️ **Do Not Disconnect Yet** — Just Identify

- [ ] **Purpose:** Brake lines may be routed along bed; need to know where
- [ ] **Trace from master cylinder:**
  - Master cylinder is inside cab, to left of steering column
  - Two hard steel lines exit master cylinder
  - Route along left and right sides of firewall
  - Follow frame rails backward
- [ ] **Check for damage:**
  - Look for rust, bulging, cracks in any lines
  - Document with photos if damage found
- [ ] **Check for bed attachment:**
  - Some models have brake line clips on bed underside
  - Verify no brake lines are bolted to bed
  - If clips found, note for later disconnection
- [ ] **Decision Point:**
  - If no visible damage and lines not attached to bed: do not disturb
  - If damage exists or lines attached: plan replacement (outside scope of this phase)
- [ ] **Document:** "BRAKE LINES: [Condition assessment]"

#### Task 2.1.4: Emergency Brake Cable Disconnection

⚠️ **Parking Brake Bracket Must Come Off With Bed**

- [ ] **Locate bracket:** Underneath bed, center area (toward rear)
- [ ] **Identify three 15mm bolts:**
  - One bolt in front of bracket
  - Two bolts to rear of bracket
  - All three should have been soaked with penetrant
- [ ] **Do NOT remove bolts yet** (bed still fully supported)
- [ ] **Instead: Trace cables backward**
  - Two cables exit bracket toward cab
  - Follow path into cab
  - Cables enter through firewall grommet
  - **For now:** Just verify routing, do not disturb
- [ ] **Check for cable clamps:**
  - Brackets or clips holding cables to frame
  - Mark any found: "E-BRAKE CABLE CLIP"
  - Do not remove clips until bed is lifted
- [ ] **Take photo:** E-brake bracket setup

**Reference:** ComancheClub user JeepcoMJ: "Task has to come out."

#### Task 2.1.5: Disconnect Wiring Clamps & Clips

- [ ] **Identify all wiring clips:**
  - Plastic clips holding harnesses to bed structure
  - Usually along driver side where wiring runs
  - May be 3-5 clips
- [ ] **Mark with tape:** Each clip location, number them "CLIP 1", "CLIP 2", etc.
- [ ] **Photo:** All clip locations before removal
- [ ] **Removal:**
  - Gently pry clips open with flathead screwdriver
  - Do not force or break plastic clips
  - Free wiring harness from bed
  - Carefully position harness so it won't get pinched when bed lifts
- [ ] **Safety:** Verify no wires will be severed or kinked during bed removal

**Reference:** ComancheClub user earl*t: "Wiring harness is connected to bed by plastic loom fasteners — found out the hard way."

---

### Checkpoint 2.2: Final Inspection & Bolt Breakout (Day 2 - Morning)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Prerequisites:** All disconnections complete, penetrant has soaked 24+ hours

#### Task 2.2.1: Verify All Disconnections

Before attempting to move the bed, final check:

- [ ] **Fuel lines:** Check driver side frame rail
  - Verify fuel fill/vent hoses are free
  - Verify main fuel line is not connected (tank was already drained)
- [ ] **Tail lights:** Verify connector is separated
- [ ] **E-brake bracket:** Verify cables don't run to frame (only to cab)
- [ ] **Wiring clips:** Verify all harnesses freed
- [ ] **Brake lines:** Verify no brake lines attached to bed
- [ ] **Exhaust:** (If needed) Verify exhaust is not strapped to bed

**If any item is uncertain, do not proceed.** Take time now to verify.

#### Task 2.2.2: Reapply Penetrant to Bed Bolts

Even though bolts soaked 24+ hours, reapply:

- [ ] Spray PB Blaster on all 8 bolts again
- [ ] Focus extra on bolts that have been rusted the longest
- [ ] Allow 10-15 minutes to penetrate
- [ ] This helps for final breakout

#### Task 2.2.3: Initial Bolt Breakout (Without Full Removal)

⚠️ **Goal:** Just break fastener free from rust/corrosion, do not fully remove yet

**Safety:** Bed must be fully supported by truck. Do not lift yet.

- [ ] **Tool selection:**
  - Use 1/2" drive with deep well socket for 15mm bolts
  - Attach breaker bar (longest leverage available)
  - If breaker bar doesn't work: use ratchet with 6" extension + steady pressure

- [ ] **Technique:**
  - **Front bolts (2):** Accessed from inside bed, bottom
    - These are studs, bolts are on top
    - Reach inside bed, position socket on stud nut
    - Apply steady pressure counterclockwise
    - Do NOT force — if extreme resistance, apply more penetrant and wait 10 more minutes
    - Once loose, just turn 1-2 turns, then stop (leave bolt engaged, but broken free)

  - **Mid bolts (2):** Under bed, where frame arches for rear axle
    - Accessed from underneath truck (on jack stands)
    - Same technique: breaker bar, steady pressure
    - Break free but do not fully remove

  - **Rear bolts (4):** On flat frame rails behind rear wheels
    - Two on driver side, two on passenger side
    - Most likely to be badly rusted
    - Apply penetrant, wait 15 minutes between attempts
    - Use breaker bar with max leverage
    - If any bolt breaks off: do not panic, see Checkpoint 2.2.4 below
    - Break free but leave engaged

- [ ] **After all bolts broken free:**
  - Mark each bolt with masking tape: "FRONT-1", "FRONT-2", etc.
  - Document which bolts were hardest to break
  - Photo all bolt locations
  - Leave bed completely on truck (do not lift yet)

**Reference:** ComancheClub user Rubikahn: "These weren't moving, so I stopped and sprayed them again. However I broke the two in the X-member just now. How screwed am I?" — This happens. See next task.

#### Task 2.2.4: Plan for Broken Studs (If Any Break)

If a bolt breaks during breakout:

- [ ] **Note location:** Which bolt broke (e.g., "rear driver side")
- [ ] **Photograph:** Broken bolt location
- [ ] **Do not attempt to extract:** Leave broken stud in place for now
- [ ] **Plan for bed reinstall:**
  - After bed is off truck, can weld new nut to broken stud (Pete M method)
  - OR extract broken stud and install bolt through hole
  - OR drill out and use larger bolt with washer
- [ ] **Document in work log:** "Broke [location] stud during initial breakout — plan welded nut repair"

**Reference:** ComancheClub admin Pete M: "Once you pull the bed off, it's possible to weld new nuts/bolts to the bed" with photos showing the repair.

---

### Checkpoint 2.3: Bed Lift and Removal (Day 2 - Afternoon)

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Prerequisites:** All bolts broken free, all systems disconnected

⚠️ **LIFTING SAFETY:** Bed weighs 300-400 lbs. You need either:
- Professional hoist/lift, OR
- 2-3 strong people + proper technique

#### Task 2.3.1: Support Tank Before Lifting

⚠️ **Critical:** Gas tank will fall away from bed during lift — must be supported

**Option A: Door Jack Method (Recommended by NAXJA forum)**

- [ ] **Position door jack** under fuel tank, driver side
- [ ] Raise jack slowly until slight pressure is felt on tank
- [ ] Tank should not rest full weight on jack (bed still supporting most)
- [ ] This step just "preps" the tank for the next step

**Option B: Custom Support Frame (DIY option)**

- [ ] **Create 2x4 support frame:**
  - Build simple frame that spans from driver to passenger frame rail
  - Place at front of tank location
  - Height should be such that when bed is lifted, tank rests on frame
  - Can use with ratchet straps to secure tank
- [ ] **Reference:** ComancheClub user SW86: "I used two 2x4s with holes drilled to mount them to the first two sets of bed mounting points. Then used ratchet straps to hold the gas tank in and exhaust up."

#### Task 2.3.2: Lift Front Bed (Driver Side Corner)

- [ ] **Position hoist under front driver corner** of bed floor
  - Use chains through stake pocket holes if available
  - OR use soft straps to avoid marring bed edge
- [ ] **Raise slowly — 1 inch at a time**
  - Watch tank for movement (should stay relatively stable due to door jack support)
  - Watch brake lines and wiring for kinks
  - Stop and adjust if anything catches
- [ ] **Lift to about 12-18 inches** (enough to see underneath)
- [ ] **Do NOT lift higher yet** — rest at this height

#### Task 2.3.3: Break Loose Remaining Bolts Under Lifted Bed

Now with bed raised slightly, access to bolts is better:

- [ ] **Rear bolts (4):** Now fully visible
  - Apply breaker bar pressure to break final seizure
  - Once loose: fully remove and set aside on marked cloth
  - Count bolts: you should remove 4 total from rear
  - Place in labeled container: "REAR BOLTS"

- [ ] **Mid bolts (2):** Between axle arch
  - Fully remove and place in labeled container: "MID BOLTS"

- [ ] **Front bolts (2):** Inside bed
  - Reach up into bed from driver side
  - Locate studs on bed floor
  - Remove nuts completely
  - Set in labeled container: "FRONT BOLTS"

#### Task 2.3.4: Disconnect Gas Tank Straps

⚠️ **Tank Hanging Below Bed — Support Is Critical**

- [ ] **Tank location:** Hanging from underside bed, driver side with straps
- [ ] **Strap bolts:** Two studs with nuts, likely 9/16" size (per forum consensus)
  - Bolts are on underside of bed
  - Nuts hang down with tank straps
- [ ] **Door jack technique (safe method):**
  - Using the door jack positioned under tank from earlier
  - Raise jack very slowly until it takes full weight of tank
  - Slowly and gently remove strap nuts from studs
  - Once both nuts removed, strap falls away
  - Verify tank is fully supported by door jack before proceeding

- [ ] **After strap disconnection:**
  - Tank is now supported only by door jack
  - Verify jack is stable and has no downward drift
  - Leave tank supported on jack (do NOT lower to ground yet)

**Reference:** NAXJA forum: "Gas tank straps into frame rail on driver's side" and "Once the bed is half on the ground, put another sawhorse at the front."

#### Task 2.3.5: Continue Lifting Bed Off

- [ ] **Raise front of bed another 12 inches**
  - Very slowly, watching for any obstacles
  - Brake lines should have slack by now
  - Wiring harnesses should be clear
- [ ] **Check passenger side:**
  - Make sure passenger side lifts evenly
  - If one side lags, stop and check for caught wiring/lines
- [ ] **Continue until bed is clear of truck cab**
  - Full clearance needed: typically 18-24" lift
  - Test that you can see completely over cab
- [ ] **Final check:**
  - Verify tank is stable on door jack
  - Verify all brake lines and wiring are slack
  - Verify exhaust (if affected) has clearance

#### Task 2.3.6: Separate Bed from Truck Completely

- [ ] **Hoist bed completely clear** of truck frame
  - Raise at least 3 feet above truck
  - Ensure stable position
- [ ] **Move hoist with bed** to safe storage location
  - Position bed on sawhorses or cinder blocks for stability
  - Height should be 2-3 feet off ground for later work
  - Verify bed is stable (not rocking)
- [ ] **Lower hoist slowly** until bed settles onto supports
- [ ] **Disconnect hoist chains/straps** once bed is fully supported

#### Task 2.3.7: Lower Truck and Support Tank

- [ ] **Lower hoist** with truck now
  - Slowly lower truck back down to normal height
  - Watch tank position on door jack
- [ ] **Once truck is down:**
  - Verify tank is still supported by door jack
  - Do NOT lower tank to ground yet
- [ ] **Disconnect door jack:**
  - Only after tank is fully braced (next checkpoint)
  - Leave jack in place for now

---

### Checkpoint 2.4: Tank Support & Straps Removal (Day 2 - Late Afternoon)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Bed completely removed and stored, tank supported by door jack

#### Task 2.4.1: Inspect Tank Hanging Status

- [ ] **Door jack inspection:**
  - Verify jack is under tank centerline
  - Verify no downward movement over past hour
  - Check for leaks from tank (should be none if drained properly)
- [ ] **Strap inspection:**
  - Two straps now hanging loose below tank
  - They should no longer be bolted to bed
  - Verify bolts/nuts are collected

#### Task 2.4.2: Build Temporary Tank Support Frame

If you want to lower truck further or move it:

- [ ] **Option 1: Leave on door jack** (simplest)
  - Door jack is sufficient temporary support
  - Can leave in place during tank work

- [ ] **Option 2: Build support frame**
  - Use 2x4s and cinder blocks
  - Height should be ~2-3 feet
  - Must be very stable (no rocking)
  - Use when door jack is needed for other work

#### Task 2.4.3: Disconnect Fuel Line From Tank

⚠️ **Be careful not to drop tank**

- [ ] **Locate main fuel outlet line:**
  - Hard steel line from tank, near driver side
  - Has hose clamp connecting to tank outlet stub
- [ ] **Prepare drain pan** underneath
- [ ] **Loosen hose clamp:**
  - Use screwdriver to turn clamp counterclockwise
  - Remove clamp completely and set aside
  - Do NOT lose clamp (you'll reuse it)
- [ ] **Carefully pull fuel line away from tank:**
  - Line should slide free easily if drained properly
  - Expect few drops of residual fuel
  - Have shop towel ready
- [ ] **Cap fuel line:**
  - Wrap line end with cloth and secure with rubber band
  - Prevents debris/moisture entry
  - Label: "FUEL OUTLET LINE"
- [ ] **Leave fuel return line** (if present) in place until tank is off

#### Task 2.4.4: Remove Tank from Support

- [ ] **Lower door jack very slowly:**
  - One turn of handle at a time
  - Watch tank descent
  - Be ready to stop immediately if anything binds
- [ ] **As tank lowers:**
  - Strap bolts might require repositioning
  - Brake lines should clear without issue
- [ ] **Once tank is 6" from ground:**
  - Stop and verify all lines are clear
  - Verify fuel return line (if present) is free
- [ ] **Continue lowering to ground:**
  - Position tank on small blocks or wood to prevent direct ground contact
  - Tank should be stable and level once fully lowered
- [ ] **Disconnect door jack:**
  - Remove jack once tank is fully stable on blocks
  - Jack is now free for other uses

#### Task 2.4.5: Fuel Tank Decontamination & Inspection

⚠️ **Fuel System Work — Outdoor Location Required**

Tank is now fully removed. This is the time to inspect and prepare for treatment.

- [ ] **Initial inspection (external):**
  - Photograph all sides of tank
  - Look for cracks, punctures, patches
  - Check seams for rust or weeping
  - Check for impact dents (rust indicators under dents)
  - Document condition with notes

- [ ] **Tank interior inspection:**
  - **CRITICAL:** Tank must be completely drained and aired out 24+ hours
  - Can open filler cap and smell inside (should smell like old gasoline, not active fuel)
  - Use flashlight to look into tank through filler cap opening
  - Look for rust, sediment, water droplets
  - **Do NOT climb into tank (suffocation hazard)**

- [ ] **Check tank outlet and return ports:**
  - Inspect for corrosion or debris
  - If fouled: plan gentle cleaning (small brush through opening)
  - Document condition

- [ ] **Tank weight assessment:**
  - Original tank should be fairly heavy steel
  - If unusually light: could indicate previous puncture/patch or aluminum (rare on '86)
  - Note in documentation

**Reference:** This inspection will inform whether tank needs internal coating, external rust treatment, or possibly replacement.

## PART 3: FUEL TANK TREATMENT & RESTORATION

### Checkpoint 3.1: Tank Cleaning (Day 3 - Morning)

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Tank fully removed and drained, sitting on blocks

#### Task 3.1.1: External Tank Cleaning

- [ ] **Degrease exterior:**
  - Use Simple Green or Purple Power degreaser
  - Spray generously on all tank surfaces
  - Let soak 10-15 minutes
  - Scrub with soft brush to remove oil/grime
  - Rinse thoroughly with hose
  - Allow to dry completely (2-4 hours in sun)

- [ ] **Remove external rust:**
  - Use wire brush (hand held) for light surface rust
  - Use rotary wire wheel on drill for heavier rust
  - Work in direction of grain
  - Stop when bare metal is visible or rust is removed
  - Do NOT remove too much material

- [ ] **Inspect painted areas:**
  - Original tanks usually have factory epoxy coating
  - Determine if coating is intact or compromised
  - Document condition

#### Task 3.1.2: Internal Tank Inspection & Light Cleaning

⚠️ **Tank Must Be Thoroughly Dry & Aerated Before Entry**

- [ ] **Safety verification:**
  - Tank has been open and airing for 24+ hours
  - No fuel smell (only old fuel residue smell should remain)
  - Verify with nose test before proceeding
  - **If strong fuel smell remains: air for another 24 hours**

- [ ] **Light internal cleaning (if mild sediment):**
  - **Do NOT use harsh chemicals inside tank**
  - Can use distilled water rinse: fill tank 1/4 way, slosh gently, drain (if safe)
  - Use compressed air through filler opening to dry
  - Allow another 2-4 hours air dry

- [ ] **If significant rust/sediment inside:**
  - Plan commercial tank cleaning service (outside DIY scope)
  - OR use small soft brush through filler opening to brush away loose rust
  - Avoid aggressive scraping (can puncture thin tank walls)

- [ ] **Document interior condition:**
  - Take notes on rust severity
  - Use flashlight photos if possible
  - This determines next restoration step

#### Task 3.1.3: Tank Gasket & Outlet Inspection

- [ ] **Examine fuel pump gasket** (if visible at filler):
  - Original rubber may be hard/cracked
  - Plan replacement during reassembly
- [ ] **Examine fuel pump module** (visible from filler opening):
  - Pump assembly sits on tank floor with seal
  - If discolored or corroded: note for pump inspection
- [ ] **Examine outlet tube:**
  - Stub where fuel line connects
  - Should be clean and free of debris
  - If debris visible: can rinse with compressed air

---

### Checkpoint 3.2: Tank Rust Treatment & Coating (Day 3 - Afternoon/Day 4)

**Duration:** 1-2 days (includes drying time)  
**Prerequisites:** Tank cleaned and dried, interior inspected

#### Task 3.2.1: Choose Rust Treatment Strategy

Based on your tank condition assessment:

**Option A: Minor Surface Rust Only**

- [ ] External: Wire brush rust away, expose bare metal
- [ ] Internal: Allow air dry, skip internal coating
- [ ] **Cost:** Low (~$50)
- [ ] **Process:** Rust converter → Topcoat

**Option B: Light Interior Rust (Recommended for '86 Original Tank)**

- [ ] External: Wire brush + coating
- [ ] Internal: Light rust, needs protection for 10+ year shelf life
- [ ] **Cost:** Moderate (~$80-120)
- [ ] **Process:** Rust converter → POR-15 external + specialized internal coating
- **Reference:** Your tank is likely original, mostly rust-free, so this is appropriate

**Option C: Severe Rust (Tank Compromised)**

- [ ] Recommend professional tank cleaning/coating service
- [ ] OR plan tank replacement from junkyard ($50-150)
- [ ] **Cost:** High ($150-300)

**Your Decision:** Based on initial inspection, choose above option. Document choice in work log.

#### Task 3.2.2: External Rust Treatment (All Options)

- [ ] **Apply rust converter:**
  - Product: POR-15 Rust Converter OR Rustoleum Rust Reformer
  - Apply per product instructions (typically brush application)
  - Follow manufacturer's cure time (usually 24 hours)
  - Rust converter chemically converts rust to stable compound
  - **Goal:** Create paintable surface

- [ ] **Cure and inspect:**
  - Allow full cure time before next step
  - Verify all rust areas treated
  - Touch up if needed

#### Task 3.2.3: External Topcoat (All Options)

After rust converter cures:

- [ ] **Choose topcoat:**
  - Option 1: POR-15 (black epoxy, very durable, hard to remove later)
  - Option 2: Rustoleum metal paint (easier to apply and touch up)
  - Option 3: Factory-color epoxy (if restoring appearance)

- [ ] **Application:**
  - Stir paint thoroughly per instructions
  - Use natural bristle brush or lint-free roller
  - Apply thin, even coat (avoid drips)
  - Allow to cure per instructions
  - Second coat optional for durability

- [ ] **Result:**
  - Entire external tank coated
  - Protected from further rust for 5-10 years
  - Durable enough for under-truck installation

#### Task 3.2.4: Internal Coating (Option B only)

If you chose Option B (light interior rust):

⚠️ **This step requires specialty product designed for fuel tank interiors**

- [ ] **Product options:**
  - POR-15 Tank Sealer (specialty formulation for fuel tanks) — $50-80
  - Eastwood Rust Encapsulator (designed for fuel tanks) — $30-50
  - Caswell Fuel Tank Liner (DIY epoxy coating) — $60-100

- [ ] **Application method:**
  - These products are typically applied by shaking/sloshing inside tank
  - Pour measured amount into tank through filler opening
  - Cap tank and vigorously shake (coat all interior surfaces)
  - Drain excess back into can
  - Tilt tank to coat difficult areas
  - Allow to cure 24-48 hours vertically
  - Verify fumes fully dissipated before proceeding

- [ ] **Cure verification:**
  - Open cap and smell — should have minimal odor after cure
  - Interior should be smooth/glossy (sealed)
  - Not tacky to touch

**Note:** Your tank is mostly rust-free, so internal coating is optional. Many owners skip it if interior is clean.

## PART 4: FUEL LINE RESTORATION

### Checkpoint 4.1: Fuel Line Assessment & Sourcing (Day 1, Parallel to Tank Work)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours planning + ordering time  
**Prerequisites:** Tank removed, fuel system disconnected

This checkpoint should begin while tank is sitting, before tank work begins. Ordering parts takes 3-5 days.

#### Task 4.1.1: Assess Current Fuel Line System

You have an '86 Comanche with Renix TBI fuel injection. Your fuel system includes:

- [ ] **Main fuel line:** Steel hard line from tank to firewall
  - Routed along driver frame rail inside bed
  - Approximately 8-10 feet long
  - Connected to tank with hose clamp
  - Exits bed at firewall, transitions to rubber hose under hood

- [ ] **Fuel pump:** Tank-mounted (inside tank)
  - Delivers approximately 30 PSI (check your pump spec)
  - Connected to main fuel line through tank sending unit

- [ ] **Under-hood rubber hoses:** (if replacing)
  - From firewall to fuel rail or fuel pressure regulator
  - Usually 2-3 feet total
  - Factory rubber, likely dry/cracked at 38+ years

- [ ] **Return line:** (optional on '86 Renix)
  - Some '86 models have return line, some don't
  - Trace from engine bay backwards to see if present
  - If present: smaller diameter (5/16" typical)

#### Task 4.1.2: Decide on Fuel Line Replacement Strategy

**Option A: Minimal Replacement (Recommended)**

Keep existing steel hard line (bed to firewall), replace only rubber hoses and connections.

**Advantages:**
- Minimal cost ($50-100 total)
- Steel line is protected inside bed, less susceptible to road damage
- Faster installation
- Can reuse existing line routing

**Disadvantages:**
- Existing line may have internal corrosion (can't see)
- Steel line is more difficult to repair if kinked

**What you'll replace:**
- All rubber hoses under hood
- All hose clamps
- Fuel pump inlet clamp (inside tank)

**Option B: Complete System Replacement (Comprehensive)**

Replace steel hard line from tank all the way through firewall to engine.

**Advantages:**
- Complete peace of mind
- No hidden corrosion
- Fresher system throughout

**Disadvantages:**
- Much higher cost ($200-400)
- Requires professional installation if soldering hard lines
- More complex routing

**What you'll replace:**
- Entire steel hard line
- All rubber hoses
- All fittings and clamps
- Fuel pump inlet assembly (if needed)

**Your decision:** Based on tank inspection (looks rust-free), **Option A is recommended**. You'll replace rubber hoses and clamps, keeping the steel line.

#### Task 4.1.3: Parts Sourcing — Fuel Line Components

### Checkpoint 6.1: Frame Preparation (Day 5-6)

**Duration:** 1-2 days (includes drying time)  
**Prerequisites:** Bed removed, fuel/brake lines disconnected, frame exposed

#### Task 6.1.1: Frame Cleaning

Your frame is mostly rust-free (per your initial assessment). Light cleaning and surface rust removal is needed.

- [ ] **Degreasing:**
  - Use Simple Green or Purple Power degreaser
  - Spray entire frame rail, undercarriage
  - Pay special attention to areas where fuel/brake lines were routed
  - Let soak 10-15 minutes
  - Scrub with soft brush
  - Rinse thoroughly with hose

- [ ] **Wire brush surface rust:**
  - Use hand wire brush on any surface rust spots
  - Focus on: rear frame area, where water pools
  - Brush until light gray appears (not bare metal necessarily, just clean surface)
  - Do NOT use rotary wire wheel (removes too much material)

- [ ] **Allow to dry completely:**
  - Sunny day is best for drying
  - Wait 24 hours after wash before POR-15 application
  - Verify no moisture remains

#### Task 6.1.2: Check Frame Integrity

While frame is exposed:

  - Work outdoors, never in enclosed garage
  - Position upwind of fumes

- [ ] **Protect surrounding areas:**
  - Lay tarp under work area
  - Tape over any truck openings (engine bay, cab windows)
  - Protect engine from overspray

- [ ] **Gather materials:**
  - POR-15 paint (calculate quantity: ~2-4 quarts for entire frame)
  - Natural bristle brushes (avoid synthetic, POR-15 eats plastic)
  - Lint-free rags
  - Stir stick
  - Disposal container for used brushes
  - Safety glasses
  - Gloves (POR-15 is very hard to remove from skin)

---

### Checkpoint 6.2: POR-15 Application (Day 6-7)

**Duration:** 1 day application + 24-48 hours drying between coats

#### Task 6.2.1: First POR-15 Coat

- [ ] **Prepare POR-15:**
  - Stir thoroughly (color appears to separate, need good mixing)
  - Do NOT thin with solvents (unnecessary and reduces durability)

- [ ] **Application to frame rails:**
  - Use natural bristle brush
  - Apply thin, even coat to all exposed frame rails
  - Work section by section
  - Brush longitudinally (along rail length) for even coverage
  - Do NOT brush across grain or you'll leave brush marks

- [ ] **Application to suspension points:**
  - Spring mounts
  - Shock absorber mounting points
  - Control arm attach points
  - Any area exposed to weather

- [ ] **Application to undercarriage:**
  - Bottom of frame rails

  - Anywhere water pools or rust forms
  - Reach with extension painting tool if needed

- [ ] **Coverage goals:**
  - All exposed frame metal should be covered
  - Slight coverage of surrounding areas is OK (overspray is normal)
  - Do NOT oversaturate (thin, even coats are better than heavy coats)

- [ ] **Allow to cure:**
  - POR-15 dries to a hard finish in 24 hours
  - Does not fully cure until 7 days, but can apply second coat after 24 hours
  - Keep area clear of debris while drying

#### Task 6.2.2: Second POR-15 Coat (Recommended)

For long-term durability, apply a second coat:

- [ ] **After 24-hour cure:**
  - Apply same process as first coat
  - Second coat fills any voids and ensures complete coverage
  - Paint should go on smoothly over first coat

- [ ] **Allow full cure:**
  - After second coat, allow 48 hours dry time
  - Full cure takes 7 days before full strength
  - Do NOT put weight on coated areas during first 48 hours if possible

#### Task 6.2.3: Cavity Wax / Undercoating Application

After POR-15 cures:

- [ ] **Apply cavity wax** (Fluid Film or similar):
  - Spray inside all frame cavities
  - Inside rocker panels
  - Behind all components
  - This provides additional rust prevention

- [ ] **Undercoating application:**
  - Oil-based undercoating (Fluid Film, Wool Wax)
  - Spray entire undercarriage
  - Spray inside rocker panels
  - Spray door jambs

## CONCURRENT TASK TRACKING

### Phase 1 & 2 Overlap (Weeks 3-8)

Many Phase 1 and Phase 2 tasks can proceed in parallel:

**Track A: Structural/Body Work (Phase 1)**

- Exhaust system replacement
- Door welding repair
- Floor pan welding
- Frame rust treatment
- Undercoating application
- Brake system overhaul
- Steering system inspection

**Track B: Drivetrain Work (Phase 2)**

- Engine oil leak repairs
- Ignition system repair
- Engine tune-up
- Cooling system service
- Transmission fluid service
- Transfer case service
- Differential service

**Advantage:** Work proceeds on two fronts simultaneously, reducing overall calendar time.

**Coordination Needed:**

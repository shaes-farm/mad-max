**Phase 1 Notes:**

- Driveshaft ordered new from Parts Geek (Replacement brand) instead of used junkyard — safety decision
- Complete brake system rebuild: master cylinder, pads, shoes, wheel cylinders, hardware
- Parking brake cables and hardware for complete brake system refresh
- Control arm bushings (MOOG K7103 upper, K7397 lower) for steering improvements
- Hood release cable to fix failed latch mechanism
- Lug nuts and wheel studs for secure wheel mounting (20 each for full replacement)
- RockAuto order 335576040 large order split across phases (Phase 1: Brakes + Wheels)
- RockAuto 335297769 combined order across phases with single shipping charge
- Parts Geek service charge $4.12 (not tax) included in shipping total

**Major Decisions:**

- Exhaust manifold condition: Cracked? YES / NO - Cost impact: $**\_**
- Floor pan: Patch vs. full replacement: PATCH / FULL - Cost impact: $**\_**
- Front driveshaft: Safe vs. replace: ~~SAFE~~ / **REPLACE** - Cost impact: $189.28 (incl tax/ship)
- Brake condition: Pads only vs. rotors too: **BOTH** - Cost impact: $210.44

**Cash Flow Notes:**

- January front-loaded with assessment supplies and three major RockAuto orders
- All four phases (0, 1, 2, 4) initiated in January with comprehensive parts ordering
- Large RockAuto order #335576040 split across Phases 1, 2, and 4 with prorated tax/shipping
- Tools tracked separately ($109.78) for cross-vehicle use
- Phases 3-5 spending will be more spread out over coming months

## LESSONS LEARNED - BUDGET

### What Worked Well

- Large combined RockAuto orders split shipping across multiple phases efficiently
- UV dye assessment caught issues early before throwing parts at problems
- Local pickup (Home Depot, AutoZone) eliminated shipping on tools/supplies
- Thorough research prevented ordering wrong parts
- Buying complete brake system in one order ensured compatibility

### Budget Surprises (Good)

- Ignition parts much cheaper than estimated ($13.60 vs $50-65 budgeted)
- Parts Geek service charge only $4.12 (not counted as tax)
- MOOG bushings not significantly more expensive than economy brands
- Many small gaskets/seals under $5 each

### Budget Surprises (Bad)

- RockAuto shipping significant on large orders ($77.94 on order #335576040)
- Decided to buy new driveshaft ($189.28 with tax/ship) instead of gambling on junkyard unit
- Tax rate varies by vendor (11.4% avg effective rate)
- Large order #335576040 discovered late, added $471.97 to budget

### What I'd Budget Differently

- Allocate 15-20% shipping on RockAuto orders (accurate estimate)
- Budget contingency for "buy new vs. used" decisions on safety-critical parts
- Track tools separately from parts budget (different purpose/longevity)
- Break large multi-phase orders into phase-specific allocations from start

### Cost-Saving Tips for Future Projects

- **Combine orders** within same phase to save shipping (especially RockAuto)
- **Split tax/shipping** proportionally when orders span multiple phases
- **Local pickup** from AutoZone/NAPA for small orders eliminates shipping
- **Research interchange** thoroughly before ordering (XJ Cherokee parts often cheaper/more available)
- **Assess first** with proper tools (UV dye saved money vs. shotgun part replacement)
- **Parts Geek free shipping** over $99 is excellent value for large assemblies

## TAX DOCUMENTATION

If applicable, track expenses that may be tax-deductible (consult tax professional):

**Business Use Vehicle:**
If this vehicle is used for business/farm purposes, some expenses may be deductible.

| Date         | Item              | Amount    | Category            | Deductible? | Notes                          |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Jan-Feb 2026 | Parts restoration | $1,222.49 | Capital improvement | TBD         | Farm use vehicle - consult CPA |
| Jan 2026     | Tools (separate)  | $109.78   | Tools/Equipment     | TBD         | Reusable across fleet          |

**Note:** Consult with tax professional for guidance on deductibility. Farm vehicles used for livestock management may qualify for Section 179 deduction or farm business expense deductions.

---

## INSURANCE VALUE DOCUMENTATION

For insurance purposes, document restoration value:

**Receipts Organized:** YES (digitally + physical copies)  
**Photos of Work:** IN PROGRESS (documenting on ComancheClub forum)  
**Total Investment Documented:** $1,332.27 (parts + tools to date)  
**Estimated Current Value:** $**\_** (pre-restoration + parts added)  
**Insurance Notified of Improvements:** NO  
**Date Insurance Updated:** **\_**

**Recommendation:** Update insurance after Phase 1 completion when structural/safety improvements (new brake system, driveshaft) justify higher value.

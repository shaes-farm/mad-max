## RENIX FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM

### System Overview

The Renix system (named for Renault Electronique + Bendix) was a joint Renault/AMC design used 1986-1990.

**Key Components:**

- **ECM (Engine Control Module)** — Under dash, driver's side
- **Throttle Body** — Single injector, mounted on intake manifold
- **Idle Air Control (IAC)** — Stepper motor controlling idle speed

### Sensors

| Sensor                               | Location           | Function                        | Common Failure Symptoms                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPS** (Crank Position Sensor)      | Bellhousing        | Tells ECM engine speed/position | No start, stalling, intermittent dying             |
| **MAP** (Manifold Absolute Pressure) | Firewall           | Measures intake vacuum          | Poor idle, hesitation, rough running               |
| **TPS** (Throttle Position Sensor)   | Throttle body      | Reports throttle angle          | Rough idle, poor throttle response, hesitation     |
| **CTS** (Coolant Temperature Sensor) | Thermostat housing | Measures coolant temp           | Rough cold start, poor fuel economy, hard starting |
| **O2** (Oxygen Sensor)               | Exhaust downpipe   | Measures exhaust oxygen         | Poor fuel economy, rough running when warm         |

### Common Renix Issues

**Most Common Failures (In Order):**

1. **CPS failure** — Most critical. Causes no-start, stalling, intermittent dying. Keep spare in truck.
2. **Ground connections corrode** — Renix is extremely ground-sensitive. Clean all engine bay grounds regularly.
3. **TPS out of adjustment** — Causes rough idle, poor throttle response. Adjustable on some models.
4. **IAC valve dirty** — Causes idle problems. Clean regularly with throttle body cleaner.
5. **O2 sensor degradation** — Causes poor fuel economy, rough running. Replace every 50k-100k miles.

### Renix Diagnostic Notes

**Limited Self-Diagnostics:**

- Check engine light may not illuminate for all faults
- Many issues require manual testing with multimeter
- No OBD-II scanner compatibility (pre-OBD-II system)
- Fault codes can be retrieved manually (search "Renix fault codes" for procedure)

**Ground Quality is Critical:**

- Primary ground from battery to engine block must be <0.1Ω resistance
- Engine block to firewall ground must be <0.1Ω
- Sensor ground circuit must be <0.2Ω to battery negative
- Corrosion on any ground causes sensor malfunctions

**Helpful Resource:** The "Renix Bible" — search ComancheClub.com or Jeep forums for comprehensive diagnostic guide.

## COMMON 2.5L AMC I4 ISSUES

### Known Problem Areas

**Extremely Common:**

- **Exhaust manifold cracking** — The #1 failure point on 4-cylinder. Check for cracks regularly. Heat cycles cause stress fractures. Replace with quality manifold when it fails.
- **Valve cover gasket leaks** — Requires proper torque sequence (4-5 lb-ft, very light). Some applications need RTV sealant in addition to gasket.
- **Oil pressure sender leaks** — Easy replacement, very common failure. Located on passenger side of block.

**Moderately Common:**

- **Distributor wear** — Cap, rotor, and shaft bushing wear over time. Replace cap/rotor every 30k miles.
- **Head gasket failure** — Less common but watch for coolant loss, mixing, or external leaks at head gasket surface.

**Positive Characteristics:**

- Simple, robust engine design
- Not powerful (117 hp) but very reliable when maintained
- Parts readily available and inexpensive
- Easy to work on with basic tools
- Known for longevity when oil is changed regularly

## AX5 TRANSMISSION NOTES

### Characteristics

- 5-speed manual, Aisin-Warner design
- Light-duty transmission; adequate for 2.5L but not ideal for heavy loads or aggressive use
- Known as a "weak" transmission but adequate for normal use
- Direct upgrade path to AX15 (stronger) if failure occurs

### Fluid Recommendation

**Dexron III ATF recommended**, especially in cold climates:

- Smoother shifting than gear oil in cold weather
- Better synchro protection
- Factory specification for AX5
- Change every 30,000 miles or when servicing

**Alternative:** 75W-90 gear oil in warm climates, but ATF is preferred

### Known Issues

**Weak Points (In Order):**

1. **2nd gear synchro wear** — Causes grind on fast 2-3 shift. Most common failure.
2. **Reverse synchro wear** — Causes grinding when engaging reverse (your truck shows this symptom).
3. **5th gear wear** — Under sustained high-speed load, 5th gear can fail.
4. **Input shaft bearing** — Can fail with high mileage.

### Maintenance Tips

- **Fresh fluid often dramatically improves shift quality**
- Avoid aggressive/fast shifts (be gentle with synchros)
- Double-clutch into reverse if grinding
- If reverse is sticky: try shifting into 1st gear first, then reverse (helps synchro engagement)
- Change fluid every 30k miles or if quality/ease of shifting degrades

### Upgrade Path if Failure Occurs

**AX15 Transmission:**

- Direct bolt-in replacement (same bellhousing pattern)
- Much stronger (rated for 4.0L 6-cylinder)
- Cost: $500-800 used
- Gear ratios slightly different but very close
- Recommended if AX5 fails beyond repair

## NP207 TRANSFER CASE NOTES

### Characteristics (Your Vehicle)

- Command-Trac part-time 4WD system
- Aluminum case with chain drive
- **Shift Pattern:** 2WD → 4WD-Part Time (4H) → Neutral → 4WD-Low (4L)
- Moderate duty; adequate for this application

### Common Issues

**Leak Sources (In Order):**

1. **Output shaft seals** — Front and rear output seals are common leak points
2. **Input seal** — Where transmission output shaft enters transfer case
3. **Case half gasket** — Gasket between two case halves
4. **Speedometer drive seal** — Small seal where speedometer cable enters

**Mechanical Issues:**

1. **Chain stretch** — Causes noise and grinding, especially in 4L. Check chain tension when servicing.
2. **Shift linkage wear** — Can prevent full engagement of gears
3. **Shift fork wear** — Internal component that can wear over time

### Service Recommendations

- **Drain and refill every 30,000 miles**
- When servicing leaks, inspect chain for stretch (>1/2" play indicates replacement needed)
- Use only Dexron III ATF (do not use gear oil)
- Clean magnetic drain plug to check for metal contamination

### Fluid Capacity Check

**NP207 holds 4.5 pints (2.25 quarts):**

- Fill plug is on driver's side of case
- Fill until fluid runs out of fill hole
- Check with vehicle level

## GEAR RATIO IDENTIFICATION

### How to Determine Gear Ratios

**Method 1: Count Revolutions**

1. Jack up ONE wheel on axle (other wheel on ground)
2. Mark driveshaft and wheel
3. Rotate wheel exactly 2 full turns
4. Count how many times driveshaft rotates
5. Divide driveshaft rotations by 2
6. Result = gear ratio

Example: If driveshaft rotates 7 times for 2 wheel rotations:
7 ÷ 2 = 3.50 gear ratio

**Method 2: Check Axle Tag**

- Tag should be on differential cover or axle tube
- Format: "3.07" or "3L07" (3.07 ratio with limited slip)

**Common Comanche Gear Ratios:**

- 2.73:1 (rare, fuel economy)
- 3.07:1 (common, good balance)
- 3.55:1 (common, better towing)
- 4.10:1 (rare, off-road/towing)

**Front and rear MUST match** for 4WD operation.

## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

### Won't Start

**Engine Cranks But Won't Start:**

1. Check fuel pressure (should be 14.5 PSI)
2. Check for spark at plugs
3. Check CPS (crankshaft position sensor) - most common cause
4. Verify ECM is getting power
5. Check for clogged fuel filter

**Engine Won't Crank:**

1. Check battery voltage (should be 12.5V+)
2. Check battery connections
3. Test starter solenoid
4. Check neutral safety switch (clutch pedal switch)
5. Verify ignition switch is working

### Rough Idle (Cold)

**Most Likely Causes (Renix-specific):**

1. **Coolant Temperature Sensor (CTS)** - Most common cause
2. Dirty IAC (Idle Air Control) valve
3. Vacuum leaks (intake gaskets, hoses)
4. TPS out of adjustment

**Test CTS:** Should read ~3,000 ohms cold, ~300 ohms hot

### Oil Leaks

**Common Leak Sources:**

1. Valve cover gasket (top of engine)
2. Oil pressure sender (passenger side of block) - very common
3. Rear main seal (between engine and transmission)
4. Oil pan gasket
5. Front crankshaft seal
6. Distributor O-ring

**Diagnosis:** Clean engine, add UV dye, run briefly, inspect with UV light

### Overheating

**Common Causes:**

1. Low coolant level (check first)
2. Thermostat stuck closed
3. Radiator clogged or leaking
4. Water pump failure
5. Cooling fan not engaging
6. Head gasket failure (check for mixing)

**Quick Test:** Feel upper and lower radiator hoses when warm. Both should be hot. If lower is cold, thermostat may be stuck.

### No 4WD Engagement

**Common Causes:**

1. Vacuum lines disconnected (vacuum-shift front axle)
2. Transfer case linkage out of adjustment
3. Front axle vacuum motor failure
4. Transfer case internal issue

**Quick Test:** Shift to 4WD, check if front driveshaft is spinning when wheels turned.

### Brakes Feel Soft

**Common Causes:**

1. Air in brake lines (needs bleeding)
2. Brake fluid leak
3. Master cylinder failure
4. Worn brake pads/shoes

**Quick Test:** Pump brake pedal several times. If it gets firmer, air is in system. If stays soft, master cylinder may be weak.

## USEFUL FORMULAS

### Speedometer Calibration

If tire size changed or speedometer is inaccurate:

**Error Calculation:**

```
New Tire Diameter / Old Tire Diameter × Indicated Speed = Actual Speed
```

Example: Old tires = 28", New tires = 31"

```
31 / 28 × 60 mph indicated = 66.4 mph actual
```

You're going 6.4 mph faster than indicated.

### Fuel Economy Calculation

```
Miles Driven ÷ Gallons Used = MPG
```

**Expected MPG (2.5L Renix TBI):**

- Highway: 18-22 MPG
- City: 14-18 MPG
- Combined: 16-20 MPG

Lower MPG may indicate:

- Oxygen sensor failure
- Fuel system issues (pressure, injector, filter)
- Dragging brakes
- Improper tire pressure
- Heavy loads or aggressive driving

### Gear Ratio vs. Engine RPM

```
RPM = (MPH × Gear Ratio × Tire Revs per Mile) / (Transmission Gear × 60)
```

**Tire Revolutions per Mile (approximate):**

- 28" tire: 720 revs/mile
- 30" tire: 672 revs/mile
- 31" tire: 650 revs/mile

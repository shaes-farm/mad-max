## Document Relationship

This inventory is a **working inspection checklist**. As you complete each inspection:
1. Check the box [x]
2. Fill in the measurement/status
3. Add photos to `/photos/` directory
4. Update status symbols as conditions change

**For strategic context and prioritized issues, see:**
- **Jeep_Comanche_Project_Brief.md** - Known issues summary, current project phase, technical reference
- **01_PROJECT_CHARTER.md** - Project vision, success criteria, decision frameworks
- **05_WORK_LOG.md** - Detailed history of work performed and lessons learned

This document tracks **what is** (current condition). Other documents track **why** (Charter), **what's next** (Brief), and **what happened** (Work Log).

- [x] **Passenger side rear:** ✅ Condition: **Solid** Rust level: **Surface Only**
- [x] **Crossmembers:** ✅ Condition: **Solid** Rust level: **Surface Only**

**Photos:** All areas photographed

**Notes:**

- Surface rust only - this is cosmetic, not structural
- No rust-through, no holes, no cracks visible
- Frame appears straight with no previous damage
- Metal thickness looks good - solid steel throughout
- Verdict: Frame is absolutely salvageable - needs cleaning and rust treatment
- Clean, treat rust, POR-15 coating

### Unibody/Cab Structure
- [x] **Rocker panels - driver:** ✅ Condition: **Solid** Rust: **Minor Surface**
- [x] **Rocker panels - passenger:** ✅ Condition: **Solid** Rust: **Minor Surface**

- [x] **Passenger front floor:** ❌ KNOWN: Rust holes present - SIZE: 2-3"
- [x] **Transmission tunnel:** ✅ Condition: **Solid** Rust: **Minor Surface**
- [x] **Rear cab floor:** ❌ KNOWN: Rust holes present - SIZE: 1+" near drain holes

**Repair Required:** YES - welding/patching needed

**Photos:** All areas photographed

**Notes:**

- Significant rust-through holes visible, numerous smaller holes
- Larger holes approximately 2-3" diameter
- Located near what looks like a drain plug area
- Edges are crusty but not paper-thin across the whole area
- Small cracks forming but not fully through yet
- These areas will need patching but metal still has integrity

#### Immediate Recommendations

##### **Phase 0 Tasks (based on photos):**

- Wire brush frame rails - Remove loose rust, reveal metal condition
- Map floor pan holes - Measure and photograph all holes from inside cab

##### **Phase 1 Floor Pan Repair Plan:**

**Patch Welding Needed**

- Cut 6"x8" patches from 16-18 gauge sheet metal
- Estimated 2-3 patches needed for both passenger and driver side
- Cost: $30-50 in sheet metal
- Time: 1 day of welding practice
- This is perfect for learning sheet metal welding skills

**Budget Impact Update**

- Original Floor Pan Budget: $85-305
- Recommended Based on Photos: $30-80 (patch welding)
- Saving $200+ by patching instead of full replacement!

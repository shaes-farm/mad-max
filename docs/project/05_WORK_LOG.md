# WORK LOG: Mad Maxine Restoration

## Document Purpose

This is your daily/weekly journal for the restoration project. Document every work session, every discovery, every part installed, and every lesson learned. This log becomes invaluable for tracking progress, troubleshooting issues, and providing maintenance history.

**Project Start Date:** January 2026  
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Planning & Assessment  
**Current Mileage:** 118,000

## Document Relationship

This is your **daily/weekly work journal** - the chronological history of the restoration.

**Different from other tracking documents:**

- **Master Restoration Plan:** What to do (future-focused tasks)
- **Parts Tracker:** What to buy and when (shopping focused)
- **Budget Tracker:** Financial tracking (money focused)
- **Work Log:** What happened (past-focused journal) ← YOU ARE HERE

This log captures: session notes, discoveries, lessons learned, troubleshooting history, and reflections.

### Example Entry (Copy this format)

## January 24, 2026 - Phase 0 - Session 1

**Time:** 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM (3.5 hours)  
**Location:** Driveway  
**Weather:** Clear, 45°F

### Work Performed

- [x] Fixed hood latch to gain engine bay access
- [x] Photographed entire vehicle (exterior, underside, engine bay, interior)
- [x] Started CURRENT_STATE_INVENTORY documentation
- [ ] Frame inspection (not completed - need more time)

### Issues Discovered

- Hood latch cable was seized - lubricated with PB Blaster and worked free
- More extensive floor rust than expected - holes in driver floor approximately 4" x 6" and 2" x 3"
- Front driveshaft welds look very sketchy - definitely needs professional inspection

### Parts Used

| Part       | Qty   | Source       | Cost | Notes          |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------ | ---- | -------------- |
| PB Blaster | 1 can | Auto parts   | $8   | For hood latch |
| WD-40      | 1 can | Garage stock | $0   | Already had    |

### Photos Taken

- [x] Exterior all angles (20 photos)
- [x] Underside frame rails (15 photos)
- [x] Engine bay overview (10 photos)
- [x] Floor pan rust holes with measurements (8 photos)
- [x] Front driveshaft welds close-ups (5 photos)
- [x] Interior dash condition (12 photos)

### Tools Used

- Socket set
- Screwdrivers
- Pliers
- Wire brush
- Tape measure
- Camera/phone

### Lessons Learned / Notes

- Hood latch was easier to fix than expected - just needed lubrication and working the mechanism
- Need better lighting for underside photography - bring work light next time
- Floor pan rust is repairable but will need welding practice first
- Should have taken photos BEFORE trying to clean anything - lost some "before" documentation

### Next Session Plan

- [ ] Complete frame inspection with wire brush cleaning
- [ ] Measure and document all floor pan holes
- [ ] Check transfer case ID tag (NP207 vs NP231)
- [ ] Start engine bay cleaning for oil leak diagnosis

**Session Time:** 3.5 hours  
**Session Cost:** $8  
**Cumulative Time:** 3.5 hours  
**Cumulative Cost:** $8

### Example Troubleshooting Entry

### Problem: Engine won't shut off when key turned to OFF

**Date:** February 3, 2026  
**Symptoms:**

- Engine continues running after key turned to OFF position
- Must pull ECM fuse to kill engine
- Started happening randomly, now happens every time

**Tests Performed:**

1. Checked for 12V at ECM with key OFF - PRESENT (should be 0V)
2. Traced power back to ignition switch
3. Removed steering column covers
4. Tested ignition switch continuity in all positions
5. Found RUN and ACC circuits not opening in OFF position

**Root Cause:**
Ignition switch contacts worn/failed - not opening circuits in OFF position

**Solution:**
Replaced ignition switch with new Standard Ignition US-83

**Parts Used:**

- Ignition switch (Standard Ignition US-83) - $52 from RockAuto

**Time to Resolve:** 2.5 hours (including diagnosis and steering column disassembly)  
**Cost:** $52

**Lessons Learned:**

- Renix system needs ECM power cut to stop fuel injection
- Ignition switch failure is common on 30+ year old vehicles
- Taking photos during disassembly helps with reassembly
- Steering column removal easier than expected - just 4 bolts

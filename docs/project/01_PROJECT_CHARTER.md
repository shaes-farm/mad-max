## Project Vision

### Primary Purpose
**Farm utility truck** providing reliable all-weather transportation for livestock care and farm operations within 50-mile radius of property.

### Operating Environment
- **Terrain:** Dirt roads, fire roads, steep mountain grades (Southern Appalachian mountains)
- **Climate:** Hot summers, cold snowy winters, severe weather events, road salt exposure
- **4WD Use:** Winter/emergency only (not full-time off-road vehicle)
- **Reliability Requirement:** Daily-driver dependability - must start and run every time

### Capability Target
**Mild off-road capability** - NOT a rock crawler
- Fire roads and dirt roads
- Snow and ice traction on mountain grades  
- Steep inclines with loaded bed
- Reliable in extreme weather conditions

### Aesthetic Theme: "Appalachian Camouflage"
- **Exterior:** Black spray paint (HVLP sprayer application)
- **Style:** "Mad Max" rough-and-ready aesthetic - embrace the battle-worn look
- **Philosophy:** Function over form - working truck, not show truck
- **Interior:** Military-spartan styling - tidy, functional, no luxury

---

## Project Constraints

### Timeline
- **Target:** Road-worthy as soon as reasonably possible
- **Completion:** Fully functional by next winter (approx. 10-12 months)
- **Approach:** Progressive completion - critical items first, details as time allows

### Budget
- **Target Range:** $3,000 - $5,000
- **Philosophy:** Cost-conscious but willing to spend appropriately for safety/reliability
- **Flexibility:** Undefined ceiling for true safety-critical items

### Owner Capabilities
- **Background:** Engineer (software 35+ years, electrical hobby background)
- **Mechanical Skills:** Hobbyist mechanic, comfortable with most repairs
- **Electrical Skills:** Professional-level diagnostic and repair capability
- **Fabrication:** Metal working, custom parts fabrication, basic welding (improving)
- **Tooling:** Comprehensive mechanic tools, electrical test equipment, wire/stick welder, fabrication equipment
- **Limitations:** Never rebuilt engine/transmission/transfer case/axles (willing to learn)
- **Support:** Local mobile mechanic available for complex work

## Decision Framework

### Spending Priority (In Order)
1. **Safety** - Brakes, steering, structural integrity, exhaust sealing
2. **Reliability** - Must start, run, drive dependably in all conditions  
3. **Capability** - 4WD function, winter performance, load capacity
4. **Comfort** - Heat, defrost, wipers (essentials only)
5. **Aesthetics** - Last priority; embrace the rough look

### Parts Selection Philosophy

| Category | Philosophy | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Safety Items** | OEM or new only | No compromise on brakes, steering, structural |
| **Reliability Items** | New preferred, quality used acceptable | Balance cost vs. dependability |
| **Convenience Items** | Whatever works | Junkyard, used, aftermarket all acceptable |
| **Cosmetic Items** | DIY, junkyard, used | Lowest priority; avoid eBay markup |

### DIY vs. Professional Work

**DIY (Owner Performs):**
- Electrical diagnostics and repairs
- Basic mechanical repairs (fluids, filters, gaskets, hoses)
- Welding and fabrication (with skill development)
- Interior fabrication and installation
- Undercoating and rust prevention
- Parts sourcing and assembly

**Professional (Mobile Mechanic):**
- Engine/transmission/transfer case/axle rebuilds (if needed)
- Complex structural welding (frame repairs)
- Brake system overhaul (if extensive)
- Suspension geometry issues
- Tasks requiring specialized tools or certification
- Final inspection of critical safety systems

### Fabricate vs. Purchase

**Fabricate (Custom Metal Work):**
- Interior dash panels (replace missing plastic with sheet metal)
- Floor pan patches (weld repairs)
- Interior trim pieces (military-style functional replacements)
- Simple brackets, mounts, repairs

**Purchase:**
- Safety-critical components (brake parts, steering parts, suspension)
- Complex mechanical assemblies (alternator, starter, etc.)
- Specialized components (gauges, switches, wiring connectors)
- Items where fabrication is impractical or unsafe

## Technical Decisions: Keep vs. Replace Philosophy

| Component | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **2.5L AMC Engine** | KEEP | Adequate power, excellent fuel economy, proven reliable, parts available |
| **AX5 Transmission** | KEEP | Sufficient for use case, adequate with 2.5L, direct AX15 upgrade path if fails |
| **Dana 30 Front Axle** | KEEP | Adequate for mild off-road, 2.5L won't break it |
| **Dana 35 Rear Axle** | KEEP (monitor) | Adequate for use case, weak link in drivetrain, budget for D44 upgrade if fails |
| **2-3" Lift Kit** | KEEP | Already installed, functional for use case, inspect/replace worn components |
| **Falken Wild Peak AT Tires** | KEEP | New, excellent all-terrain tires, perfect for use case |

### Upgrades vs. Restoration

**Restoration Focus:**
- Return all mechanical systems to reliable operation
- Repair or replace worn/broken components
- Eliminate oil leaks, exhaust leaks, fluid leaks
- Restore functional electrical systems
- Weatherproof and seal cabin

**Minimal Upgrades:**
- Quality shocks appropriate for lift (if current are worn)
- Undercoating for rust prevention
- Upgraded lighting only if factory is inadequate
- NO performance upgrades (engine, transmission, axles) unless failure requires replacement

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Truck (Road-Worthy Target)
- [ ] Starts reliably in all weather conditions
- [ ] All forward gears and reverse shift smoothly
- [ ] 4WD engages properly (4H and 4L)
- [ ] Brakes provide confident, safe stopping on mountain grades
- [ ] Steering is precise with no dangerous play or binding
- [ ] No exhaust intrusion into cabin (CO safety)
- [ ] Heater and defroster work adequately
- [ ] Windshield wipers clear effectively
- [ ] All required safety lights function (headlights, brake lights, turn signals)
- [ ] No major fluid leaks
- [ ] Cab is weathertight
- [ ] Doors open, close, and latch securely
- [ ] Driver's window operates (or is sealed if inoperable)

### Fully Restored Target (Next Winter)
- All Minimum Viable criteria met
- All minor fluid leaks addressed
- All electrical accessories functional (horn, gauges, interior lights)
- Interior is tidy and complete (military-spartan style)
- Undercoating applied and rust prevention complete
- All cosmetic repairs complete (black paint applied)
- 4WD system fully tested and proven reliable
- Extended test drives completed without issues
- Maintenance schedule established and documented

### Unacceptable Outcomes (Project Failures)
- Vehicle remains unreliable (frequent breakdowns)
- Safety systems remain compromised (brakes, steering, exhaust)
- Budget significantly exceeded (>$7-8K) without proportional value
- Timeline extends beyond 18 months for basic road-worthiness
- Frame or structural rust discovered to be beyond reasonable repair

## Risk Management

### Known High-Risk Items
1. **Frame rust severity** - Could require extensive welding or render project unviable
2. **Wiring harness condition** - May require full replacement ($500-800)
3. **Engine mechanical condition** - May require rebuild ($1500-2000)
4. **Transfer case condition** - May require rebuild ($400-800)
5. **Front driveshaft safety** - Described as "welded junk parts" - immediate replacement likely

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early assessment:** Inspect high-risk items in Phase 0 before significant investment
- **Budget reserve:** Maintain 20-30% contingency for unexpected failures
- **Progressive investment:** Complete phases sequentially - don't over-invest before critical items are verified
- **Expert consultation:** Have mobile mechanic inspect questionable structural/safety items
- **Decision points:** Establish "go/no-go" criteria at each phase

### Project Kill Criteria (When to Abort)
- Frame rust is structural and beyond safe repair
- Multiple major mechanical failures (engine + transmission + transfer case all need rebuilds)
- Total repair costs exceed 2x the vehicle's potential value (~$8-10K threshold)
- Safety-critical components cannot be sourced or repaired
- Owner's time/energy/interest is exhausted

- Budget impacts noted for each decision
- Deviations from original plan explained

### Progress Tracking
- Phase completion checklists maintained
- Budget vs. actual spend tracked continuously

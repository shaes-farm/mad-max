# Mad Maxine — 1986 Jeep Comanche MJ Restoration

A long-term mechanical restoration of a 1986 Jeep Comanche MJ ("Mad Maxine") as a farm utility
truck for SHAES Farm. The goal is a reliable, capable daily driver for mountain roads and livestock
care — not a show truck. Cosmetics are irrelevant; mechanical integrity is everything.
